React/Redux Express Starter Pack repository link: 
https://github.com/bradtraversy/react_express_starter

Also, The analogous version of the starter without Redux is here reported:
https://github.com/bradtraversy/react_redux_express_starter
I used this version but I modified the Redux part

Quick Start
# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Install dependencies for client
npm run client-install

# Install react and react-redux
npm install --save redux

# Run the client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

# Run the Express server only
npm run server

# Run the React client only
npm run client

# Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
